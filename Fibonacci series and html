public class FibonacciSeries {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 10; // change n to generate a different number of terms in the series
        int a = 0;
        int b = 1;
        int c;
        
        System.out.print(a + " " + b); // print the first two terms
        
        for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
            c = a + b;
            System.out.print(" " + c);
            a = b;
            b = c;
        }
    }
}
In this example, we initialize the variables a and b to 0 and 1, respectively, which are the first two terms of the Fibonacci series.
We then use a for loop to generate the next n terms of the series. In each iteration of the loop, we calculate the next term c by adding the previous two terms a and b.
We then print out c and update the values of a and b to continue the sequence.
